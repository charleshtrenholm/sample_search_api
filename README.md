# sample_search_api

## General SDK information
This is a [KBase](https://kbase.us) module generated by the [KBase Software Development Kit (SDK)](https://github.com/kbase/kb_sdk).

You will need to have the SDK installed to use this module. [Learn more about the SDK and how to use it](https://kbase.github.io/kb_sdk_docs/).

You can also learn more about the apps implemented in this module from its [catalog page](https://narrative.kbase.us/#catalog/modules/sample_search_api) or its [spec file]($module_name.spec).

## filter_samples
the `filter_samples` function is designed to be used by front-end applications that require searching samples based on their metadata. the user specifies a series of conditions.

Conditions are defined by a sample controlled metadata field, a "value", and a comparison operator with which to compare them (i.e. "metadata_field"="latitude", "metadata_value"="56.00", "comparison_operator"=">", which create the expression: "latitude > 56.00").

In order to define multiple such conditions a logical operator to combine statements is used, either "AND" or "OR". these combine the current statement with the following one. There is currently no option for defining statements that would require parenthesis or a different order of operations for these logical operators. The order used to combine statements is as follows:
		1.) "AND"
		2.) "OR"

# Setup and test

Add your KBase developer token to `test_local/test.cfg` and run the following:

```bash
$ make
$ kb-sdk test
```

After making any additional changes to this repo, run `kb-sdk test` again to verify that everything still works.

# Installation from another module

To use this code in another SDK module, call `kb-sdk install sample_search_api` in the other module's root directory.
